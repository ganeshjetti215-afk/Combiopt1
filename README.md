# Combiopt1
Builds a unified framework to solve combinatorial optimization problems (like TSP, Knapsack, Graph Matching) using Greedy heuristics, Divide &amp; Conquer breakdowns, Dynamic Programming memoization, Backtracking search, and Branch &amp; Bound pruning, comparing their performance in real-world datasets.
